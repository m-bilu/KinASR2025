# Overview

We present a large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) corpus for Kinyarwanda, The dataset was created by Digital Umuganda and made possible through funding from the Gates Foundation. The data spans five high-impact domains—Health, Government, Financial Services, Education, and Agriculture—to support robust ASR model development in both conversational and formal contexts.

The challenge is structured around three progressive tracks that cater to different resource and expertise levels:

Track A – Small – 500 hours of fully transcribed Kinyarwanda speech

Track B – Medium – 1 000 hours of fully transcribed Kinyarwanda speech

Track C – Large – 1 000 hours of transcribed speech plus 1 000 hours of unlabeled Kinyarwanda audio

Across these tracks, participants will build, fine‑tune, and evaluate state‑of‑the‑art speech‑to‑text systems that advance accessibility, innovation, and research. The event welcomes researchers, students, startups, and hobbyists worldwide.
